# Gradle Wrapper Scripts

The `gradlew` script is a Unix Shell script used to run the project with Gradle without requiring the developer to manually install Gradle. It checks for the required Java version, sets up necessary environment variables, and runs the Gradle command.

```
#!/bin/sh

The `gradlew.bat` script serves the same purpose as `gradlew` but is used for Windows environments. It sets up the environment and runs the Gradle command.

# Gradle Settings

The `settings.gradle` file is used to define the configuration for the Gradle build. In this case, it sets the root project name to 'aidial-core'.

```gradle
rootProject.name = "aidial-core"


```

# Gradle Build Configuration

The `build.gradle` file is where the build is configured. It specifies the plugins to use, the group and version of the project, Java version, checkstyle configuration, repositories, dependencies, and application settings. It also defines the tasks for testing and distribution.

```gradle
plugins {
    id "java"
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'application'
    id 'io.freefair.lombok' version '8.0.1'
}

group = 'com.epam.aidial'
version = "0.13.0-rc"

java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)
    }
}

checkstyle {
    configDirectory = file("$rootProject.projectDir/checkstyle")
}

repositories {
```

# Gradle Wrapper Properties

The `gradle-wrapper.properties` file contains properties for the Gradle Wrapper. It specifies the distribution URL for downloading Gradle, the base directory for the distribution, the path for the distribution, and the validation for the distribution URL.

```ini
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip
networkTimeout=10000
validateDistributionUrl=true
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```
