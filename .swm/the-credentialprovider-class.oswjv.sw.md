# What is CredentialProvider

`CredentialProvider` is an interface in the `ai-dial-core-demo` project. It is used to provide a unified way to get credentials for different storage options. The `CredentialProvider` interface is implemented by different classes to provide credentials for specific storage providers like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Store.

# Variables and functions

`CredentialProvider` does not have any variables as it is an interface. It has a single function `getCredentials`.

## Function: getCredentials

The function `getCredentials` is declared in the `CredentialProvider` interface. This function is used to get the credentials required for accessing the storage. The specific implementation of this function depends on the class implementing the `CredentialProvider` interface.

```java
    Credentials getCredentials();
```

`DefaultCredentialProvider` is an example of a class that implements the `CredentialProvider` interface. It provides a default implementation for the `getCredentials` function.

```java
public class DefaultCredentialProvider implements CredentialProvider {
```
